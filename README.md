### What is StormLikes?
[**Like4Book**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/StormLikes) is a tools used to get free likes on Instagram.

You can get 10-20 likes in an hour!

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://youtu.be/y5ccUAE4RxU). Then you enter this command into termux!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/StormLikes
$ cd "StormLikes"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/StormLikes" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### Why is my account checkpointed?
- Complete your account with your phone number and email to be safe.
- Frequently change passwords on fake accounts.
- I suggest using a new account or a fake account to log in.

### Why login failed?
- Maybe Instagram has blocked your fake account password, try changing the password.
- Maybe your fake account has been checkpointed or disabled.
- We recommend using airplane mode before logging into the tools.
- You entered the wrong password.
- Please log in to **"[bigtakip.com](https://bigtakip.com)"** manually then repeat the login in tools.

### Likes don't arrive?
- Maybe the website is being repaired or is undergoing maintenance.
- Maybe this service doesn't have users to exchange likes.
- Maybe you entered the wrong post link or your Instagram account is locked.

### What is recommended?
We expect every user to use a new account or a fake account to log in to the tool and all problems may be caused by the website being under maintenance.
